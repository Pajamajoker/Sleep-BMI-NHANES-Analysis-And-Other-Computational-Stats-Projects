# The NHANES dataset contains important health information that I need for my analysis. 
# If the 'NHANES' package isn't installed, I will install it right away.

# In this analysis, I am trying to understand if physical activity and BMI have any significant
# on blood pressure levels. To do this, I used the NHANES dataset, which contains health-related
# data from participants of different ages and backgrounds. The dataset provides key variables
# like systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, BMI, and self-reported physical
# activity status. The goal was to see if physical activity or BMI has a measurable impact on
# blood pressure by conducting hypothesis testing.
# 
# First, I set up two hypotheses. The null hypothesis assumes there is no significant difference
# blood pressure between people with different BMI categories or activity levels. On the other hand,
# the alternative hypothesis suggests there are meaningful differences between these
# groups. These hypotheses help guide the analysis, as rejecting the null hypothesis would
# indicate that factors like BMI and physical activity do influence blood pressure levels.
# 
# Before starting the actual test, I cleaned the data to remove rows with missing or irrelevant
# values. Since the analysis focused on adults, I excluded data for participants below 18 years
# old. I also made sure that variables like physical activity, which were categorical, were
# correctly formatted as factors in R for the analysis. This cleaning step is important to make
# sure the data is accurate and reliable.
# 
# 
# After cleaning the data, I calculated some basic descriptive statistics to get an overview
# of the variables.Table 1 presents the summary statistics for key variables such as systolic and diastolic blood
# pressure, BMI, and physical activity levels. It provides the mean, standard
# deviation, and sample size for each variable. This helps to understand the overall distribution.
# The values in this table show us general trends like higher average blood pressure in
# inactive participants and those with elevated BMI. This table is importatn as it gives a starting
# point for the hypothesis tests by providing insights into variability and trends in the data.
# Table 1 gave me a sense of how the blood pressure readings varied across participants with
# different activity levels and BMI categories. It was becoming clear that inactive individuals
# and those with higher BMI had higher blood pressure on average.
# 
# 
# Next, I performed z-tests to compare the mean blood pressure values in different groups.
# For example, I compared the systolic blood pressure of physically active participants with
# the inactive participants. Similarly, I checked if the blood pressure readings of people with
# higher BMI were significantly different from those with a normal BMI. The p-values obtained
# from these z-tests helped determine whether the observed differences were statistically
# significant.
# 
# Tables 2a and 2b show more detailed comparisons between groups. Table 2a shows the mean
# differences in systolic and diastolic blood pressure between physically active and inactive
# participants.The results indicate a nice and clear trend, with active individuals having lower average
# blood pressure. This difference is statistically significant. THis highlights the importance
# of exercise in maintaining healthy blood pressure levels.
# 
# Table 2b focuses on BMI categories and their impact on blood pressure.
# It compares participants with normal, overweight, and obese BMI values. The stats
# highlight that participants with higher BMI tend to have significantly elevated blood
# pressure, both systolic and diastolic. These tables hightligght how different lifestyle
# factors impact blood pressure, helping to validate the conclusions drawn from the hypothesis tests.
# 
# After looking ta table 2a and 2b and the interpret_result function outputs results were quite clear. The p-values for both activity
# level and BMI comparisons are below and above the threshold of 0.05 in different cases. 
# This means Typically, inactive individuals and those with higher BMI do tend to exhibit elevated blood pressure,
# but not all analyses find statistically significant results for these factors in every subgroup.

# In conclusion, while the results indicate meaningful differences, it’s essential to consider the limitations of this analysis, 
#including the sample size and the potential influence of confounding variables.
# Even if so, these insights are valuable for guiding public health recommendations and promoting awareness
# about the benefits of exercise and weight management.
