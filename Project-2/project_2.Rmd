# =============================================
# Execution Section: Task List in Sequence

# Step 1: Prepare the dataset.
df <- prepare_data()
str(df) # Display the structure of the cleaned dataset to verify.

# Step 2: Compute descriptive statistics for the full dataset (Table 1).
table1 <- compute_summary(df)
print("Table 1: Descriptive Statistics")
print(table1)

# Step 3: Fit a multiple regression model to predict SBP using BMI and Age.
model <- fit_model(df)

# Step 4: Generate diagnostic plots for the regression model.
# In this step, I generated diagnostic plots (Residuals vs Fitted and Q-Q Plot) for the initial model.
# The goal was to check if the model assumptions (such as normality of residuals) were met.
# However, the Q-Q plot revealed that the residuals deviate from normality, indicating potential issues.

diagnostics <- diagnostic_plots(model)
print("Displaying Diagnostic Plots:")
print(diagnostics$res_vs_fitted)
print(diagnostics$qq_plot)

#I used below two points to visually validate the res_vs_fitted plot
#Random Scatter: If the points are scattered randomly around the horizontal line at zero, it suggests the model is appropriate and the residuals are normally distributed.
#Patterns: If the points show a clear pattern (e.g., curve or trend), it might indicate a non-linear relationship that the model is not capturing.
  

# Step 5: Adding this extra step because I think 
# To address the normality issue observed in Step 4, I transformed the response variable (SBP) 
# by taking its logarithm.
# After fitting the transformed model and generating new diagnostic plots, the Q-Q plot showed slightly
# improved alignment with normality, indicating that the transformation was meaningful
df_transformed <- df %>%
  mutate(SBP_transformed = log(SBP))
model_transformed <- lm(SBP_transformed ~ BMI * Age, data = df_transformed) 
diagnostics_transformed <- diagnostic_plots(model_transformed)

print("Displaying Transformed Model Diagnostic Plots:")
print(diagnostics_transformed$res_vs_fitted)
print(diagnostics_transformed$qq_plot)

# Step 6: Interpret the results of the transformed model.

# =============================================
# Conclusion Section
# =============================================
#In this analysis, I aimed to understand how BMI and age affect systolic blood pressure (SBP) using the NHANES dataset, which includes health data from people of different ages and backgrounds. I conducted multiple regression analysis, focusing on the interaction between BMI and age, and used diagnostic checks to ensure the model's reliability.

#Data Preparation
#I selected key variables like age, sex, height, weight, SBP, diastolic blood pressure,
#diabetes status, and physical activity. Categorical data such as sex and diabetes were
#converted into factors. I cleaned the dataset by removing rows with missing values for accuracy.

#Descriptive Statistics (Table 1)
# Basic statistics (mean, standard deviation, sample size) gave an overview of SBP, 
# BMI, and age. The data showed trends like higher SBP in participants with elevated 
#BMI.

# Regression Analysis and Diagnostics
#I built a multiple regression model with an interaction term between BMI and age
#to predict SBP. Diagnostic plots (residual vs. fitted and Q-Q plots) revealed issues
#with normality, so I log-transformed SBP to improve the model. The transformed 
#model showed better results.

#Results and Conclusion
#The regression results showed that both BMI and age significantly influence SBP. 
#The interaction term indicated that the effect of BMI on SBP changes with age.
#These findings highlight the combined impact of weight and age on blood pressure.

#In conclusion, BMI and age are important factors for predicting SBP. 
#This analysis supports the need for public health measures focused on weight
#management and age-specific health strategies.
