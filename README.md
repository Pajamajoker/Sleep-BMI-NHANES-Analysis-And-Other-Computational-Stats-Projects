# **Overview**

This project analyzes the relationship between **sleep patterns** and **Body Mass Index (BMI)** using data from the **National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)**. The study focuses on adults, examining:

- Sleep duration
- Snoring frequency
- Daytime sleepiness
- BMI
- Demographic variables such as age, gender, and ethnicity.

# **Study Purpose**

The goal of this study is to:

- Investigate how sleep-related factors correlate with **BMI** in adult populations.
- Understand the influence of demographic factors such as **age**, **gender**, and **ethnicity** on these relationships.

# **Key Research Parameters**

### Sleep Variables:
- **Sleep Duration**: Total hours of sleep per night.
- **Snoring Frequency**: How often the individual experiences snoring.
- **Daytime Sleepiness**: Subjective experience of sleepiness during the day.

### Health Outcome:
- **Body Mass Index (BMI)**: A measure of body fat based on height and weight.

### Demographic Factors:
- **Age**: Age of the participants (16-80 years).
- **Gender**: Male or female participants.
- **Ethnicity**: Racial and ethnic background of participants.

# **Methods**

### Data Preparation
- **Datasets Used**: Merged NHANES datasets: `DEMO_I.XPT`, `SLQ_I.XPT`, and `BMX_I.XPT`.
- **Data Cleaning**: 
  - Removed rows with missing essential values.
  - Converted categorical variables into factors.
  - Standardized time-related data (e.g., sleep duration).

### Statistical Analysis
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Summary statistics for numerical and categorical variables.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Investigated relationships between sleep patterns and BMI.
- **Multiple Linear Regression**: Analyzed predictors of BMI.
- **Diagnostic Plots**: 
  - Residuals vs. Fitted plots
  - Q-Q Plot for normality checks
- **Multicollinearity Check**: Using Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) to ensure no high correlation among predictors.

### Data Visualization
- Created **interactive plots** and **graphs** to visually demonstrate key relationships and distributions.

# **Key Findings**

- **Demographic Diversity**: 
  - Age range: 16-80 years.
  - BMI range: 14.5 - 67.3.
  - Near-equal gender distribution and diverse ethnic representation.
  
- **Sleep Pattern Variability**: 
  - Significant differences in sleep duration, snoring frequency, and daytime sleepiness across the population.
  
- **BMI Predictors**: 
  - Multiple linear regression found significant predictors of BMI, including **sleep duration**, **snoring frequency**, **daytime sleepiness**, **age**, and **gender**.

- **Model Robustness**: 
  - Diagnostic plots and multicollinearity checks confirmed the reliability of the regression model.

# **Conclusion**

This study sheds light on the complex relationship between **sleep patterns** and **BMI** in adults. Key takeaways include:

- Sleep duration and sleep-related factors are significant predictors of BMI.
- Demographic factors, such as **age** and **gender**, also play a role in BMI.
  
These insights are important for developing targeted public health strategies and interventions to address obesity and sleep-related issues.
